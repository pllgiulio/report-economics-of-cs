# Mirai - Economics of Cybersecurity

#### Security metrics

The data about Mirai infections we used for our analysis can be found [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/0vw5WT2GgorszwR).

The additional data we used for counting IP addressed for each country can be found [here](https://download.ip2location.com/lite/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB1.CSV.ZIP).

In the folder you also find the script used to create the graphs. Before running it, set as **Working directory** the directory containing the downloaded dataset. The Mirai one has to be called `360data.csv` while the one with the IPs has to be `ip.csv`.
